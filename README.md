Going through the "Hello World" GitHub guide

Hi, I'm D. Usualy go by DCBell (decibel) online. Just starting my github/coding journey. 
Would like to become a real developer/engineer someday. Or at least understand what all this does.

I'd like this space to just be a general diary, or scratchpad while I work on code.
At the moment I'm starting with learning Python as it seems like a good overall starting point, 
but evenutally I hope to expand into other languages ie C++, etc.

Maybe learn some LUA and create some basic WoW addons as a project. First things first though, 
learning Python.

Going through the different types of data in Python with the help of a Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda.
Wish I could pick this up and go through it faster.
