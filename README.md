# hello-world
Going through the "Hello World" GitHub guide

Hi, I'm D. Usualy go by DCBell (decibel) online. Just starting my github/coding journey. 
Would like to become a real developer/engineer someday. Or at least understand what all this does.

I'd like this space to just be a general diary, or scratchpad while I work on code.
At the moment I'm starting with learning Python as it seems like a good overall starting point, 
but evenutally I hope to expand into other languages ie C++, etc.

Maybe learn some LUA and create some basic WoW addons as a project. First things first though, 
learning Python.

Going through the different types of data in Python with the help of a Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda.
Wish I could pick this up and go through it faster.

10/8/18:
Found a couple of apps to help practice coding on my phone. Finally got through basic data types in Python.
The "test" I took went ok, got pretty confused on the harder stuff like calling 3x+ nested dictionaries mixed
with lists. Only to find out in the review answers that it's not typical of code to look like that (I guess it 
was written all "in-line"?) in fact it is pretty bad and so it's only use is for practice. 

So I don't feel too down about that... 
Though from my initial answers I was on the right track mixing keys with indexing. 

10/10/18:
Getting pretty late here so I don't know if I'll read or watch more tutorials on Python. Didn't post yesterday
because I'm wondering if it's more effective to just write stuff down when I have something "interesting" rather
than "today I wrote 'hello world' for the 5000th time".

Went over the basics of comparison operators yesterday, if anyone wonders.

Don't know if I'll do anything tonight mostly because I'd like to re-read about the things I've learnt before 
moving on. Though I feel like that may be what holds me back in a weird way.

My mood isn't too great, not trying to put personal stuff in here but it's been pretty tiresome for me irl.
