# hello-world
Going through the "Hello World" GitHub guide

Hi, I'm D. Usualy go by DCBell (decibel) online. Just starting my github/coding journey. 
Would like to become a real developer/engineer someday. Or at least understand what all this does.

I'd like this space to just be a general diary, or scratchpad while I work on code.
At the moment I'm starting with learning Python as it seems like a good overall starting point, 
but evenutally I hope to expand into other languages ie C++, etc.

Maybe learn some LUA and create some basic WoW addons as a project. First things first though, 
learning Python.

10/7/18:
Going through the different types of data in Python with the help of a Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda.
Wish I could pick this up and go through it faster.

10/8/18:
Found a couple of apps to help practice coding on my phone. Finally got through basic data types in Python.
The "test" I took went ok, got pretty confused on the harder stuff like calling 3x+ nested dictionaries mixed
with lists. Only to find out in the review answers that it's not typical of code to look like that (I guess it 
was written all "in-line"?) in fact it is pretty bad and so it's only use is for practice. 

So I don't feel too down about that... 
Though from my initial answers I was on the right track mixing keys with indexing. 

10/10/18:
Getting pretty late here so I don't know if I'll read or watch more tutorials on Python. Didn't post yesterday
because I'm wondering if it's more effective to just write stuff down when I have something "interesting" rather
than "today I wrote 'hello world' for the 5000th time".

Went over the basics of comparison operators yesterday, if anyone wonders.

Don't know if I'll do anything tonight mostly because I'd like to re-read about the things I've learnt before 
moving on. Though I feel like that may be what holds me back in a weird way.

My mood isn't too great, not trying to put personal stuff in here but it's been pretty tiresome for me irl.

10/14/18:
It's been a few days since I've posted. TBH didn't really keep up with learning Python while I've been 'absent'. No excuses,
just sorta fell behind and busy with other issues. Started learning some more basics today (as I write this). Hope to get
over this hump and start creating something. Theory is great but ultimately useless if not put into practice.

10/16/18:
Was called in for jury duty yesterday so I didn't get much done other than starting to handwrite/type notes on what I've covered so far.
Just now noticed the 'h' key on this laptop feels like it's sticking, not that the keyboard on this already felt like mush, fun times 
ahead. 

Going through loops and other basic/entry level functions now. Tuple unpacking seems to be a very important thing to get down. 

10/20/18:
Not been up to much, sadly. Midterms start this week, and I've been trying to get all normal assignments/projects done and out of the way ontop of thinking of switching majors and other boring university stuff. Still going through loops and other operators. Since I haven't had time to learn new stuff, I've been writing down notes and almost caught up to where I am tutorial wise. 

10/23/18:
Finished with the next section in the Python course I'm in, but there's an assessment/check that I don't feel I'm ready for. I sorta remember and understand the concepts that were being taught but to be honest, without some sort of practice problems it seems very hard for me to keep up. I know I should probably write stuff by hand everyday or find a Python exercise site, but the ones I've found are still a bit too advanced for me (like I'm one chapter behind where they'd be useful). Kind of dispointed in this section more than anything, the first section was filled with practice problems and hands on stuff while this one seems empty. The next section seems better as it looks like that wraps up with my first "big" project. 

Oh and midterms started for me this week - yay. On the upside though I'm sorta enjoying the very little coding I've learned and am thinking of switching to CS as a major, though it's not completely nessessary. The math I'm not really worried about since I'm already in a math/theory heavy major.
