Going through the "Hello World" GitHub guide

Hi, I'm D. Usualy go by DCBell (decibel) online. Just starting my github/coding journey. 
Would like to become a real developer/engineer someday. Or at least understand what all this does.

I'd like this space to just be a general diary, or scratchpad while I work on code.
At the moment I'm starting with learning Python as it seems like a good overall starting point, 
but evenutally I hope to expand into other languages ie C++, etc.

Maybe learn some LUA and create some basic WoW addons as a project. First things first though, 
learning Python.

Going through the different types of data in Python with the help of a Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda.
Wish I could pick this up and go through it faster.

Found a couple of apps to help practice coding on my phone. Finally got through basic data types in Python.
The "test" I took went ok, got pretty confused on the harder stuff like calling 3x+ nested dictionaries mixed
with lists. Only to find out in the review answers that it's not typical of code to look like that (I guess it 
was written all "in-line"?) in fact it is pretty bad and so it's only use is for practice. 

So I don't feel too down about that... 
Though from my initial answers I was on the right track mixing keys with indexing.
